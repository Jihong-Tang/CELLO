Active Development

## Introduction
Cancer EvoLution for LOngitudinal data (CELLO) is a MATLAB toolbox for comprehensive analysis of longitudinal genomic sequencing data in cancer. It was originally developed by Jiguang Wang [1,2], and the implementation has both MATLAB and R versions:
* [MATLAB](./CELLOM/CELLOM.md)
* [R](./CELLOR/CELLOR.md)

## Docker

To ensure reproducibility and improve usability, we have prepared a [docker](https://www.docker.com/) version of CELLO, based and the R implementation. The docker can be retrieved by
```
docker pull qmu123/cellor
```
Alternatively, one can build the docker image from scratch. The docker file is uploaded to this repository. Download the [Dockerfile](./CELLOR/Dockerfile) and [CELLOR.R](./CELLOR/CELLOR.R) into a directory, then build the image from there by:
```
docker build -t cellor .
```
## Datasets

The input [SAVI report](./input.savi.txt) consists of a list of genetic variants from 90 glioblastoma patients [1].
